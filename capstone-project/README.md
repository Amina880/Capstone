# Capstone
The project that interested me the most was project option 4: Recipe Finder. 
I chose this project as my capstone because I enjoyed developing the recipe-sharing platform we had to do in the previous weeks of the program. Additionally, I enjoy cooking and exploring recipes on the internet during my free time. I was also intrigued by this project because I have always wanted to create such a web application from the ground up. This is a great opportunity to build on the concepts I have already learnt in the program such as integrating APIs, managing state, and designing a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

This will be set up as a React Project using:
TailwindCSS for styling
React Router for routing 
Axios for data requests from API
Vercel for deployment

The main features are:
Fetches Recipe Data
Recipe Details View
Search Functionality
Favorites List
Recipe Categories
Responsive UI Design
Error Handling
